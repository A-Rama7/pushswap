The goal of the project is to return the series of actions for sorting a list. You will have two lists : l_a and l_b.

The l_b starts empty and l_a contain the list of integers you need to sort.

The objective can be to sort the l_a list, but there is a mystery strategy of only printing and not sorting, that gives you great performances, but I donâ€™t know this technique so you are going to sort the l_a list.

the list of actions allowed :

    sa: swap the first two elements of l_a.

    sb: swap the first two elements of l_b.

    sc: swap the first two elements of l_a and swap the first two elements of l_b.

    pa: take the first element from l_b and move it to the first position on the l_a list.

    pb: take the first element from l_a and move it to the first position on the l_b list.

    ra: the first element of l_a will become the last.

    rb: the first element of l_b will become the last.

    rr: the first element of l_a will become the last and the first element of l_b will become the last.

    rra: the last element of l_a will become the first.

    rrb: the last element of l_b will become the first.

    rrr: the last element of l_a will become the first and the last element of l_b will become the first.
